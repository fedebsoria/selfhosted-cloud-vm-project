# ðŸ’» Cloud Server Architecture and Security Documentation

This document details the architecture, service allocation, and security considerations for the cloud server project, which includes the manual installation of Nextcloud and the use of the Cloudflare Tunnel for external access.

## ðŸ”’ Generalized Server Diagram (Security Obfuscated)

This diagram shows the service layout and traffic flow. Specific ports and the names of high-value management tools have been generalized to avoid their exposure in a public portfolio.

    %% TRAFFIC FLOWS AND CONNECTIONS (Arrows)

    C --> Host %% Local and Internet traffic entering the server
    
    Host -- Tunnel (HTTPS) --> NC_Web %% Cloudflare Tunnel connects to Nginx, which serves Nextcloud
    NC_Web --> DB %% Nextcloud connects internally to its database
    
    %% DIRECT LOCAL ACCESS VIA IP:PORT (Generalized/hidden ports)
    D -- App Port 1 --> G %% Access to Local Homepage (Homer)
    D -- Mgmt Port 1 --> J %% Access to Container Manager (Portainer)
    D -- Mgmt Port 2 --> P %% Access to Host Web Manager (Cockpit)
    D -- SMB Access --> M %% Access to network shared folders
    D -- DNS (53) --> L %% Device uses Unbound as DNS server

    %% REMOTE ACCESS VIA ZEROTIER
    K -- VPN Access --> P %% Access to Host Web Manager via ZeroTier
    K -- VPN Access --> G %% Access to Media Streaming App via ZeroTier
    K -- VPN Access --> M %% Access to Shared Files via ZeroTier
    
    subgraph "Storage"
        %% The large-capacity disk
        N("8TB External HDD")
    end
    
    %% STORAGE DEPENDENCIES
    NC_Web -- Mounts/Writes --> N %% Nextcloud stores and writes files to the disk
    M -- Shares --> N %% File Sharing Protocol shares the disk's folders
